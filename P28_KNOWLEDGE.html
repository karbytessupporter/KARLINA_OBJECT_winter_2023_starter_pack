<p><span style="background: #ffff00">The following terms and their respective definitions describe <strong>knowledge</strong> as an emergent (and relatively abstract) property of the relatively physical processes which occur inside the hardware of a sufficiently complex <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a>. Note that the following definitions might not pertain to their respective terms used outside the scope of <strong>this website</strong> (i.e. the website named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a>).</span></p>

<p><strong>DATA:</strong> (singular: datum) <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">phenomena</a> which are non-ambiguously represented as finite sequences of <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/bits_and_bytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">binary digits</a> such that, when those sequences of binary digits are transmitted from one information processing agent to some other information processing agent, both information processing agents interpret those transmitted sequences of binary digits as symbolically representing the exact same phenomena.</p>
<p>An example of a datum is an <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_data_types" target="_blank" rel="noopener">int</a> type variable named N being instantiated as a result of a particular <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/factorial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C++ program</a> being compiled and executed. For the duration of that int variable&#8217;s instantiation, that int variable has the relatively abstract properties of whatever four-byte values are stored inside of that variable (depending on the time the variable is checked to see what value it presently stores (and that variable can only store one int type value at one time)) and the relatively physical properties of an immutable reservation of some finite number of contiguous <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">memory cells</a> inside of the executing digital computer&#8217;s electronic hardware and the particular arrangement of <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electrons</a> inside of those particular memory cells which each correspond with a particular int type value.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>INFORMATION:</strong> a collection of data which are organized in a particular spatial and temporal configuration such that those data collectively refer to some piece of knowledge which neither one of those data could wholly represent by itself.</p>
<p>Note that it is possible for one information processing agent to classify a particular collection of data named D as data while some other information processing agent classifies that same piece of data as information. The information processing agent which classifies D as mere data instead of as more complete information presumably considers D to be missing essential components which are required to make D whole (i.e. self contained) rather than merely an isolated fragment of a whole.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>KNOWLEDGE:</strong> an <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emergent property</a> which occurs as a result of a sufficiently complex information processing agent subjectively interpreting some piece of information such that the resulting interpretation is not wholly communicable.</p>
<p>It could be said that what is transmitted between multiple information processing agents is information and what each of those information processing agents subjectively experiences is knowledge (which means that, <u>unlike information and data, knowledge is a solipsistic phenomenon</u>).</p>
<p>An example of knowledge is karbytes&#8217; <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental</a> model of reality (and karbytes is the sole author of this website).</p>
<p>Each of the words, images, and sounds which have been encoded as sequences of computer-readable binary digits and stored as <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/public_domain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">files</a> inside of <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web servers</a> and which comprise this website were consciously selected to be included in this website by karbytes instead of any other pieces of information due to the fact that those pieces of information which karbytes selected were the first to trigger specific neuronal firing patterns in karbytes&#8217; <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brain</a> which indicated that those pieces of information fit sufficiently well into the puzzle which is karbytes&#8217; mental model of reality (and, in karbytes&#8217; universe from karbytes&#8217; human vantage on the surface of Planet Earth in a region named California on the day named 21_SEPTEMBER_2023 at the 24-hour clock cycle point named 12:30PM Pacific Standard Time, that mental model of reality contains more information than what this website contains).</p>
<p>To elaborate on the portion of the previous sentence which is encapsulated inside of parentheses, this website is, within a spatially and temporally finite context, metaphorically a set of terms which have corresponding definitions inside of the dictionary which is karbytes&#8217; mental model of reality. Within that spatially and temporally finite context, when karbytes views a web page within this website, a (relatively physical) cascade of electrical impulses occurs inside of karbytes&#8217; brain which causes karbytes to experience a (relatively abstract) reconstruction of memorized information associated with the (finite, immutable, and verbatim <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digitization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digitized</a> (and verbatim transmissible)) <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_content" target="_blank" rel="noopener">content</a> which is displayed on that web page.</p>

<p>(The following quoted text was published as a Twitter post by karbytes on 08_AUGUST_2023: <u>â€œThe mission of karbytes is to (at least imagine attempting to) create prose and code in the form of computer intepretable digital files which encodes essential logic for recreating and preserving the entire multiverse.&#8221;</u>)</p>
