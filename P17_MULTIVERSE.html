<p><span style="background: #ffff00">The following terms and their respective definitions describe <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nature</a> (i.e. the whole of reality) as being the set which contains all universes simultaneously and immutably.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>UNIVERSE:</strong> exactly one <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">space-time</a> continuum which contains a finite amount of <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matter</a> and <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">energy</a> which is arranged in a particular pattern (according to a partial frame of reference which appears to itself to be inhabiting that space-time continuum) and such that the observed pattern of energy and matter changes as the time within that space-time continuum elapses according to that observing partial frame of reference which observes that passage of time as the appearance and the disappearance of specific phenomena.</p>
<p>An <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a>, A,  which perceives itself as being a finite subset of its encompassing universe (i.e. environment), E, may possibly perceive phenomena which are interpreted by A as evidence of there being information processing agents which are not A and which are also inhabiting E.</p>
<p>Suppose A&#8217;s mental model of reality suggests that E simultaneously contains A and some other information processing agents, B and C. If B and C are each information processing agents with a similar degree of information processing ability as A, then it could be said that A, B, and C are each information processing agents which are either directly or indirectly interacting with each other inside of one shared <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meta-universe</a> due to the fact that each A, B, and C inevitably updates E by interacting with E (yet each A, B, and C technically inhabits its own unique <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solipsistic</a> universe).</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ABSOLUTE_SOLIPSISM:</strong> the hypothetical state of there being exactly one information processing agent throughout all of nature such that no phenomena exist outside of that information processing agent&#8217;s frame of reference.</p>
<p>(Logically speaking, all imaginable noumena exist unconditionally).</p>
<p>If absolute solipsism is true, then the frame of reference which is observing this web page is the only frame of reference throughout all of nature which currently exists (and, also, no information processing agent other than you has ever existed nor will ever exist nor presently exists).</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>MULTIVERSE:</strong> the hypothetical coexistence of multiple universes simultaneously.</p>
<p>Hypothetically speaking, nature can be described as a multiverse which contains every imaginable universe simultaneously and immutably such that nature contains infinitely many possible universes at all times (whether any of those universes are noumenal or else phenomenal).</p>
<p>According to the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;many worlds hypothesis&#8221;</a>, every possible outcome to every decision exists inside of its own separate universe (and when a decision is made, the universe in which that particular decision is made splits into as many separate universes as there are possible outcomes to that decision).</p>

<p>(The following quoted text is a modified copy of a Twitter post which karbytes posted on 08_AUGUST_2023: <u>&#8220;I hypothesize that every phenomenon is the only one of its kind throughout some multiverse (and that multiverse may or may not be a subset of a larger encompassing multiverse). What I mean to suggest is that every phenomenon (but not necessarily every noumenon) is always instantiated using a unique and finite allocation of space, time, matter, and energy.&#8221;</u>)</p>

<p>(The following quoted text is a copy of a Twitter post which karbytes posted on 07_NOVEMBER_2023): <u>&#8220;The probability that something other than pure nothingness exists throughout all existence is always larger than zero percent. The fact that this sentence is being read right now is proof that the previous sentence is true.&#8221;</u></p>
