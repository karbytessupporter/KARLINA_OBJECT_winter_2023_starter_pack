<p>S: &#8220;Are numbers noumena or are numbers phenomena?&#8221;</p>
<p>T: &#8220;I would say that any finite sequence of numeric digits (with no more than one radix and no more than one sign) which is currently being represented as a pattern of physical objects inside of some information processing agent&#8217;s hardware (even if that information processing agent is merely a component of a software simulation) is a number which exists as a phenomenon from the perspective of that information processing agent&#8217;s encompassing universe. In other words, the only numbers I consider to actually exist are the values (which phenotypically manifest as finite linear sequences of numeric digits (with no more than one radix per sequence and no more than one sign per sequence)) which are currently being represented by whatever computer program variables are currently instantiated. I believe that most numbers which are theorized to exist are each in a purely noumenal state most of the time rather than in a phenomenal state most of the time (though I could be wrong (especially if all imaginable phenomena exist simultaneously and eternally throughout a limitlessly large set of parallel and temporally circular universes)).&#8221;</p>
<p>S: &#8220;Are you suggesting that, if all imaginable phenomena exist simultaneously and eternally throughout a limitlessly large set of parallel and temporally circular universes, there are as many phenomenal numbers as there are noumenal numbers (from the perspective of an all-encompassing multiverse)?&#8221;</p>
<p>T: &#8220;Initially, I am inclined to say yes to your question because, if all imaginable phenomena exist simultaneously and eternally throughout a limitlessly large set of isolated and limitlessly repeating universes, then there are infinitely many phenomenal incarnations of each noumenal number throughout all time (i.e. throughout the boundlessly large multiverse). I do not think it is possible for a spatially and temporally finite information processing agent to algebraically compare two infinities the way that information processing agent can algebraically compare the numbers 5 and 2 (to see that there is a precise difference of 3 spaces on the number line between the points labeled 2 and 5). Hence, I reason that any object is always either known (to some beholder) as a spatially, temporally, and energetically finite pattern or else that object is not known to that particular beholder and possibly neither to any other beholders.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following paragraphs (enclosed inside of quotation marks) are modified excerpts from a journal entry which was written by karbytes on 07_OCTOBER_2023.</p>
<p>&#8216;&#8230;Science is the &#8220;vehicle&#8221; by which I traverse a simulation I may have created but have since forgotten that I created. Within the simulated universe I created I also instantiated into as an avatar with agency and with self awareness (and with self aware agency which could seamlessly traverse infinitely many different levels of simulated reality as one continuous space-time continuum (and each of those levels of simulated reality can be conceptually modeled as a &#8220;middle level&#8221; spherical shell inside of a nested series of spherical shells))&#8230;</p>
<p>It may be the case that there are infinitely many parallel versions of me each inside of its own uniquely corresponding solipsistic universe (which is fundamentally a computer simulation using discrete rather than continuous values for constituting objects with mass). Note that discrete (rather than continuous) signals can be verbatim encoded as sequences of binary digits which two information processing machines each decode to produce the same qualitative value.</p>
<p>It may be the case that there exist infinitely many parallel universes (which are each a simulation being run on a digital computer) such that each of those simulated versions of me (and that me&#8217;s respective universe) is a simulation which some parallel me built.</p>
<p><u>In order for <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/count_down_timer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time</a> to exist, it seems that there needs to be some kind of (self aware) <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a> experiencing exactly one space-time continuum.</u> I think that time is entirely subjective rather than objective and that, from the <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiverse&#8217;s</a> (most macroscopic) perspective, all moments are eternally frozen (i.e. changeless) and eternally instantiated.&#8217;</p>
